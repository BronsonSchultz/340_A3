# 340_A3
Two Scala assignment questions. 

problem1 deals with a map of the royal family tree and extracting information about the family.  
  
problem2 is an implementation of the Partial type. This type is similar to the Either type but accumulates error messages through  
runtime if multiple errors were to occur, giving more detail than an Either.
